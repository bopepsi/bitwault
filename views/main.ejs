          <h1>Welcome to PasswordKeepR!</h1>
          <article>
            We are a storage system for passwords for organzations. Organizations have many different accounts which
            need to be shared between users. PasswordKeepR will let an authorized user acess all the passwords of the
            organization. The app will also let a user generate a new password for a specific account. Users will be
            able to generate a password based on the options the form will provide. Some of the options are: password
            length, contains lowercase, contairs uppercase, contains numbers, and contains symbols.

            If a user needs to log in to a specific website (e.g. Facebook) they can go into the app, find the
            appropriate password, click a button which copies the password into the clipboard, and log in.
